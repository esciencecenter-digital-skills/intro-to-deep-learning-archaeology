## Different types of layers
Networks are like onions: a typical neural network consists of many layers. In fact, the word *deep* in *Deep Learning*
refers to the many layers that make the network deep.

So far, we have seen one type of layer, namely the **fully connected**, or **dense** layer. This layer is called fully connected, because all input neurons are taken into account by each output neuron. The number of parameters that need to be learned by the network, is thus in the order of magnitude of the number of input neurons times the number of hidden neurons.

However, there are many different types of layers that perform different calculations and take different inputs. In this episode we will take a look at **convolutional layers** and **dropout layers**, which are useful in the context of image data, but also in many other types of (structured) data.

## Image classification
Keras comes with a few prepared datasets. We have a look at the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html),
which is a widely known dataset for image classification.
~~~
from tensorflow import keras
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## CIFAR-10
>
> The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of images of 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
> It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for image classification. The low resolution of the images in the dataset allows for quick loading and testing models.

We take a small sample of the data as training set for demonstration purposes.

The training set consists of 50000 images of `32x32` pixels and 3 channels (RGB values). The RGB values are between `0` and `255`. For input of neural networks, it is better to have small input values. So we normalize our data between `0` and `1`:


~~~
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

The labels are single numbers denoting the class.
We map the class numbers back to the class names, taken from the documentation:

~~~
class_names = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer',
               'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']
~~~
{: .language-python}


Now we can plot a sample of the training images, using the `plt.imshow` function.
~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.title(class_names[train_labels[i,0]])
plt.show()
~~~

## Convolutional layers
In the previous episodes, we used 'fully connected layers' , that connected all input values of a layer to all outputs of a layer. This results in many connections, and thus weights to be learned, in the network. Note that our input dimension is now quite high (even with small pictures of `32x32` pixels), we have:


~~~
dim = train_images.shape[1] * train_images.shape[2] * train_images.shape[3]
print(dim)

We can decrease the number of units in our hidden layer, but this also decreases the number of patterns our network can remember. Moreover, if we increase the image size, the number of weights will 'explode', even though the task of recognizing large images is not necessarily more difficult than the task of recognizing small images.

The solution is that we make the network learn in a 'smart' way. The features that we learn should be similar both for small and large images, and similar features (e.g. edges, corners) can appear anywhere in the image (in mathematical terms: *translation invariant*). We do this by making use of a concepts from image processing that precede Deep Learning.

A **convolution matrix**, or **kernel**, is a matrix transformation that we 'slide' over the image to calculate features at each position of the image. For each pixel, we calculate the matrix product between the kernel and the pixel with its surroundings. A kernel is typically small, between 3x3 and 7x7 pixels. We can for example think of the 3x3 kernel:
~~~
[[-1, -1, -1],
 [0, 0, 0]
 [1, 1, 1]]
~~~
{: .output}
This kernel will give a high value to a pixel if it is on a horizontal border between dark and light areas.
Note that for RGB images, the kernel should also have a depth of 3.

In the following image, we see the effect of such a kernel on the values of a single-channel image. The red cell in the output matrix is the result of multiplying and summing the values of the red square in the input, and the kernel. Applying this kernel to a real image shows that it indeed detects horizontal edges.
![Example of a convolution matrix calculation](../fig/04_conv_matrix.png)
![Convolution example on an image of a cat to extract features](../fig/04_conv_image.png)

In our **convolutional layer** our hidden units are a number of convolutional matrices (or kernels), where the values of the matrices are the weights that we learn in the training process. The output of a convolutional layer is an 'image' for each of the kernels, that gives the output of the kernel applied to each pixel.

> Suppose we apply a convolutional layer with 100 kernels of size 3 * 3 * 3 (the last dimension applies to the rgb channels) to our images of 32 * 32 * 3 pixels. How many parameters do we have? Assume, for simplicity, that the kernels do not use bias terms. Compare this to the answer of the previous exercise
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > We have 100 matrices with 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 values each so that gives 27 * 100 = 2700 weights. This is a magnitude of 100 less than the fully connected layer with 100 units! Nevertheless, as we will see, convolutional networks work very well for image data. This illustrates the expressiveness of convolutional layers.

So let us look at a network with a few convolutional layers. We need to finish with a Dense layer to connect the output cells of the convolutional layer to the outputs for our classes.

~~~
inputs = keras.Input(shape=train_images.shape[1:])
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name="cifar_model_small")

model.summary()

Often in convolutional neural networks, the convolutional layers are intertwined with **Pooling layers**. As opposed to the convolutional layer, the pooling layer actually alters the dimensions of the image and reduces it by a scaling factor. It is basically decreasing the resolution of your picture. The rationale behind this is that higher layers of the network should focus on higher-level features of the image. By introducing a pooling layer, the subsequent convolutional layer has a broader 'view' on the original image.

Let's put it into practice. We compose a Convolutional network with two convolutional layers and two pooling layers.


~~~
inputs = keras.Input(shape=train_images.shape[1:])
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(50, activation='relu')(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name="cifar_model_small")

We compile the model using the adam optimizer (other optimizers could also be used here!).
Similar to the penguin classification task, we will use the crossentropy function to calculate the model's loss.
This loss function is appropriate to use when the data has two or more label classes.

To calculate crossentropy loss for data that has its classes represented by integers (i.e., not one-hot encoded), we use the SparseCategoricalCrossentropy() function:
~~~
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
~~~
{: .language-python}

We then train the model for 10 epochs:

~~~
history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10,
                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
~~~
{: .language-python}


We can plot the training process using the history:

~~~
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

history_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(history.history)
sns.lineplot(data=history_df[['accuracy', 'val_accuracy']])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{: .language-python}
![OPlot of training loss and validation loss vs epochs for the trained model](../fig/04_training_history_loss_1.png)

It seems that the model is overfitting somewhat, because the validation accuracy and loss stagnates.

## Dropout

Note that the training loss continues to decrease, while the validation loss stagnates, and even starts to increase over the course of the epochs. Similarly, the accuracy for the validation set does not improve anymore after some epochs. This means we are overfitting on our training data set.

Techniques to avoid overfitting, or to improve model generalization, are termed **regularization techniques**.
One of the most versatile regularization technique is **dropout** ([Srivastava et al., 2014](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)).
Dropout essentially means that during each training cycle a random fraction of the dense layer nodes are turned off. This is described with the dropout rate between 0 and 1 which determines the fraction of nodes to silence at a time.
![A sketch of a neural network with and without dropout](../fig/neural_network_sketch_dropout.png)
The intuition behind dropout is that it enforces redundancies in the network by constantly removing different elements of a network. The model can no longer rely on individual nodes and instead must create multiple "paths". In addition, the model has to make predictions with much fewer nodes and weights (connections between the nodes).
As a result, it becomes much harder for a network to memorize particular features. At first this might appear a quiet drastic approach which affects the network architecture strongly.
In practice, however, dropout is computationally a very elegant solution which does not affect training speed. And it frequently works very well.

**Important to note:** Dropout layers will only randomly silence nodes during training! During a predictions step, all nodes remain active (dropout is off). During training, the sample of nodes that are silenced are different for each training instance, to give all nodes a chance to observe enough training data to learn its weights.

Let us add one dropout layer towards the end of the network, that randomly drops 20% of the input units.

~~~
inputs = keras.Input(shape=train_images.shape[1:])
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(50, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.Dropout(0.8)(x) # This is new!
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(50, activation='relu')(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

model_dropout = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name="cifar_model")

We can see that the dropout does not alter the dimensions of the image, and has zero parameters.

We again compile and train the model.
~~~
model_dropout.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history_dropout = model_dropout.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=20,
                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
~~~
{: .language-python}

And inspect the training results:
~~~
history_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(history_dropout.history)
history_df['epoch'] = range(1,len(history_df)+1)
history_df = history_df.set_index('epoch')
sns.lineplot(data=history_df[['accuracy', 'val_accuracy']])

test_loss, test_acc = model_dropout.evaluate(test_images,  test_labels, verbose=2)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~

![Plot of training loss and validation loss vs epochs for the trained model](../fig/04_training_history_loss_3.png)

Now we see that the gap between the training accuracy and validation accuracy is much smaller, and that the final accuracy on the validation set is higher than without dropout.
Nevertheless, there is still some difference between the training loss and validation loss, so we could experiment with regularization even more.
